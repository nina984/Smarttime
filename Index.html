    <h2>Why Time Management Matters</h2>
    <p>Meet Alex, a student just like you, struggling with managing his time. Even though he's studying hard, his grades aren't as good as he hoped. He's been reading, but something's missing...</p>
    <img src="https://example.com/alex-image.jpg" alt="Alex studying" />

    <h2>The Big Revelation</h2>
    <p>After a long night of searching for answers, Alex discovers something life-changing: Time management is key! He learns about the Eisenhower Matrix and realizes that he's been spending too much time on tasks that aren't urgent or important. 🙈</p>

    <h2>So, What is the Eisenhower Matrix?</h2>
    <p>The Eisenhower Matrix is a time management tool that helps you prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance. It divides tasks into four categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Urgent and Important:</strong> Do it now! 📅</li>
        <li><strong>Important, Not Urgent:</strong> Plan for it. ⏳</li>
        <li><strong>Urgent, Not Important:</strong> Delegate if possible. 👥</li>
        <li><strong>Not Urgent, Not Important:</strong> Avoid it! 🚫</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By applying this matrix, Alex started tackling his tasks more effectively, leading to a big improvement in his grades. Now he knows exactly where to focus his efforts. 🔥</p>

    <h2>Other Time Management Techniques</h2>
    <p>Besides the Eisenhower Matrix, here are a few more tips Alex used to boost his productivity:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pomodoro Technique:</strong> Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Repeat! ⏱️</li>
        <li><strong>Time Blocking:</strong> Set specific times for specific tasks during your day. 📅</li>
        <li><strong>Daily and Weekly Reviews:</strong> Reflect on what you've done and plan ahead! 🔍</li>
    </ul>
