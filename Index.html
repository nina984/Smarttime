    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Many students struggle to achieve top grades despite putting in hours of study. Often, the root cause isn't intelligence or dedication, but rather <strong>poor time management</strong>. This is the story of Alex, a student who turned his academic life around after discovering a powerful method: <strong>The Eisenhower Matrix</strong>.</p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581093588401-1ccdcafe3f6b" alt="Student thinking deeply">

<h2>Discovering the Eisenhower Matrix</h2>
<p>The concept was simple yet revolutionary. Tasks are divided based on <strong>importance</strong> and <strong>urgency</strong>. Here's what the matrix looks like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Important & Urgent</strong> – Do it now!</li>
  <li><strong>Important but Not Urgent</strong> – Plan it.</li>
  <li><strong>Not Important but Urgent</strong> – Delegate it.</li>
  <li><strong>Not Important & Not Urgent</strong> – Eliminate it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Putting It Into Action</h2>
<p>Alex drew the matrix on paper. He started sorting out his tasks each morning. Homework and studying went into the first two boxes. Social media and useless meetings went into the last.</p>
